- [ ] My change does NOT alter the **build dependencies** (including `go.mod`, `go.sum`, `pom.xml`, `deps.env`, `requirements.txt`, and `package.json`).
  - If your change modifies dependencies, please describe why this is needed.
  - We should only change dependencies early in a release cycle (preferably right after a release).
  - New dependencies should not use this [list of problematic licenses](https://cloudera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/1768063150/List+of+problematic+licenses+for+CDE).
  - For `go.mod` changes, any replace mod declaration that pins a module version should have an end of line comment linking to a description as to why pinning is required.

  
- [ ] My change does not require additional **backup support**.
  * If your change saves new information to a top-level Job or Resource structure, updates are required [to support backup and restore](https://github.infra.cloudera.com/CDH/dex/blob/develop/pkg/runtime/service/v1archive.md#supporting-backup-and-restore-of-new-features-in-jobs).
  * If your change may impact backup and restore, please describe.
  
- [ ] My change does not impact the **CLI**.
  * Adding new functionality or backward-incompatible changes to the API might require CLI changes.
  * Jobs API changes affect CDECLI, and control plane API changes affect CDPCLI.
  
- [ ] My change does not fix **build stability** issues
  * If it does, then please inform the current release captain and backport it to n-1 release branch (even if its a hotfix branch) and PvC branch
  * It is release captain's responsibility to ensure that these fixes should go into previous release branches so that hotfixes can have more velocity

  * If there are any api changes. Run make clients and include the changes in your PR.

  * It may also be required to mention the new endpoint in the Release Notes or send a TSB to notify customers who have limited outbound network access that they should whitelist the new endpoint.
